## Overview

The SpacesTek Final application demonstrates the integration of the **MediaSFU React Native Expo SDK**, enabling robust audio media functionalities within an Expo-managed React Native project. This iteration introduces dynamic room creation, real-time audio visualization, and host-level participant controls.

---

## From Initial to Final

The transition from **SpacesTek Initial** to **SpacesTek Final** includes significant enhancements, such as:

1. **MediaSFU SDK Integration**:
   - Added the `mediasfu-reactnative-expo` package for real-time audio and participant management.
   - Implemented `MediaSFUHandler` for encapsulating MediaSFU-specific logic.

2. **Dynamic Room Management**:
   - Added features to create and join rooms dynamically with seamless server synchronization.

3. **Audio Media Enhancements**:
   - Introduced `AudioLevelBars` for real-time audio visualization and interaction.

4. **Participant Management**:
   - Enabled hosts to mute, remove, and ban participants with real-time updates.

5. **No-UI MediaSFU Configuration**:
   - Configured MediaSFU to operate without the default UI for flexible customization.

6. **Backend Synchronization**:
   - Enhanced API integration for consistent room and participant states across the backend and frontend.

---

## Key Features

- **Audio Control**:
  - Mute/unmute functionality for local and remote participants.
  - Visual representation of real-time audio levels.

- **Dynamic Room Management**:
  - Create or join rooms with customizable settings.

- **Participant Management**:
  - Host-level controls for muting, removing, or banning participants.

- **Backend Integration**:
  - Synchronized backend states with the frontend for consistent room and participant management.

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Install MediaSFU React Native Expo SDK

Install the `mediasfu-reactnative-expo` package:

```bash
npm install mediasfu-reactnative-expo
```

---

### Step 2: Implement MediaSFUHandler

Create the `MediaSFUHandler` component to encapsulate MediaSFU functionalities.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { MediasfuGeneric } from "mediasfu-reactnative-expo";

const MediaSFUHandler: React.FC = () => {
  return <MediasfuGeneric />;
};

export default MediaSFUHandler;
```

---

### Step 3: Enhance SpaceDetails Component

Integrate `MediaSFUHandler` into the `SpaceDetails` component for dynamic room management.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import MediaSFUHandler from "./MediaSFUHandler";

const SpaceDetails: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <MediaSFUHandler />
    </View>
  );
};

export default SpaceDetails;
```

Add real-time audio visualization with `AudioLevelBars`:

```tsx
import AudioLevelBars from "./AudioLevelBars";

<AudioLevelBars audioLevel={audioLevel} />;
```

---

### Step 4: Configure Backend Communication

Update the backend server and application configuration:

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Update `index.ts`** in the `api` folder with the server URL and configuration:
   ```typescript
   const SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3001';
   const USE_SERVER = true;
   ```

---

### Step 5: Final Testing and Adjustments

1. **Test Audio Controls**:
   - Join the room as multiple participants.
   - Test mute/unmute functionalities.

2. **Participant Management**:
   - Mute, remove, or ban participants from the host interface.

3. **Handle Alerts**:
   - Verify proper alert messages for room states and participant actions.

---

## Key Components

### MediaSFUHandler
Encapsulates all MediaSFU-specific functionalities for room creation and management.

### SpaceDetails
Central component for managing room states and integrating `MediaSFUHandler`.

### AudioLevelBars
Displays real-time participant audio levels for better interaction visibility.

### Backend Integration
Ensures synchronization between server and frontend states for consistent behavior.

---

## Final Notes

This final version of SpacesTek demonstrates the power of **MediaSFU** for building scalable, real-time communication applications with React Native Expo. While this iteration emphasizes audio media functionalities, additional features like video integration or custom UI components can be explored.
